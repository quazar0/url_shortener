# url_shortener
A link shortening service.

This service is up and running.  It is accessible via [jsn9.sytes.net](http://jsn9.sytes.net/).

You can go to that web page and enter a URL into the form to generate a short URL,
or to have a shortened URL expanded.

Or you can make API calls to the service.
See the [test/test_client_via_curl.sh](https://github.com/quazar0/url_shortener/blob/master/test/test_client_via_curl.sh) script for an example using _curl_.

Feel free to take a look at the design document
[docs/design.doc](https://github.com/quazar0/url_shortener/blob/master/docs/design.doc).
